# OnlineMarketplace
Joole, Inc., based in Palo Alto, California, USA (“Company”), intends to develop an online                           
marketplace for building products. The marketplace has two types of users: consumers                       
(designers and builders) who use the website to efficiently find the best products to meet their                               
design requirements and customers (building product manufacturers) who use the website to                       
effectively market relevant products at the decision point.
